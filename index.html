                    <h1>Chandra Prakash</h1>
                    <p>An IIT Guwahati graduate with a passion for understanding the universe at its most fundamental level.</p>
                    <p>I am motivated by a deep curiosity for learning and strive to explore concepts in as much depth as possible. I believe in <strong>opening up science</strong> by sharing resources as widely as possible to help the next generation of researchers, which is why I've provided my notes in the notes section where the derivations are as explicit as possible. My work focuses on quantum field theory in curved spacetime, quantum aspects of gravity, inflation, Reheating, black holes in cosmological coupling, holographic duality, unitary evaporation of black holes, string theory, and other gravity-related aspects. I possess a decent understanding of many areas related to gravity but am currently focusing on <strong>honing my skills towards holography</strong>.</p>

                            <p><strong>Under the kind guidance of Dr. Debaprashad Maity</strong></p>
                            <p>Our current understanding of gravity is limited by observational constraints. While building a particle accelerator the size of the solar system isn't feasible, the universe has provided an alternative. Inflation, the highest-energy process in the early universe, acts as a natural laboratory. My thesis explored how particle production and quantum field dynamics during this era imprint on cosmological correlation functions, with a focus on non-Gaussianity and observable signatures in the CMB. This work introduces reheating into collider physics to study its distinct imprint on the CMB, aiming to make a distinction between signals of particle production and particle interactions.</p>

                            <p><strong>Under the kind guidance of Prof. Lalita Rane</strong></p>
                            <p>My undergraduate thesis was driven by a fundamental question: how does the de Broglie hypothesis survive in Quantum Field Theory? I was captivated by the problem that for ultra-relativistic particles, the corresponding wavelength becomes extremely small. This led me to investigate whether such particles exhibit wave-particle duality at all. My research explored the eigenvalue of the momentum operator in QFT to conclude that the de Broglie hypothesis is a statement on the eigenvalue of the momentum eigenstate.</p>

                            <p>I extended the concept of entanglement entropy from quantum mechanics to quantum field theory and applied it to spacetimes with a Lorentz-violating field. My work explores how such a field affects entanglement entropy and finds that it converges with the one derived from Bekenstein's arguments. I also investigated two widely used procedures for calculating entanglement entropy, finding that the heat kernel method requires certain modifications in the presence of non-minimal coupling.</p>

                            <p>This project was completed a while ago, but due to a collaborator's lack of availability, it was not put on arXiv. I am currently reviving the work with the hope of submitting it soon. The research explores how the Newman-Janis algorithm, a method I recently learned, can be applied to models of Lorentz-violating gravity. I am currently studying the black hole shadow of the resulting metric and plan to share the explicit details of my work soon.</p>
